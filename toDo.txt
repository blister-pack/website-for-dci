Idea is to make a DRG recruitment page
    DRG would be a ral company inviting people to become miners (players) by talking about the game
    we'll go over some aspects of the game like memes, missions and bugs, mission control etc


*Implement:

Autoplay RockAndStoneNeverAlone.mp3 or with an event (like hover over title)
choose font (x)
footer w link to steam game
navi needs to go to place in website

images in cards
sounds
animations





*Cute Ideas:
change cursor to a pickaxe
Header fade out DRG and fade in Deep Rock Galactic



*Fix:
nav bar moves when hover


*Oopsies:
idk why reset didn't take away bullet points on list (x)
